# Pi HPC Introduction

<span class="small">Last Update 5 April 2024</span>

Welcome to PI HPC, an instructional tool for instructors and students to explore the world of distributed computing with a hands-on guided experience through the process of building, configuring, and managing a miniature cluster computer. While the harware may differ from the systems found on the [Top500](https://top500.org), the fundementals remain the same. By mastering the principles underlying cluster computing, students will be equipped with valuable skills applicable to both small-scale projects and large-scale infrastructures.

In this digial era, the demand for scalable and efficient computing solutions continues to rise. Understanding how to harness the power of cluster computing is becoming increasingly essential across various fields, from data science and artificial intelligence to scientific research and beyond.
